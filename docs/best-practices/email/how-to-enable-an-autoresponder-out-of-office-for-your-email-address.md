# How to Enable an Autoresponder/ Out of Office for Your Email Address

**Please note that this only applies to Service Panel users who log in via service.byte.nl. We don't offer email hosting for our international customers at the moment.**

You can use an autoresponder when you are not available for a period of time, for example a vacation. An autoresponder will send an automatic message to whoever sends you an email with an automatic message you can compose yourself.

In this article, we explain how to enable an autoresponder for email addresses that you have created via the Service Panel.

## Autoresponder at Hypernode

Hypernode has an autoresponder option for all your email addresses. As soon as email arrives for you on the Hypernode mailserver and you have enabled an autoresponder for that email address, the text you set will be sent to the sender address.

It may occur that an autoresponder sends a message to an address where another autoresponder also automatically replies to the email. To prevent a conflict between the two autoresponders, Hypernode's autoresponder sends an email to the sender once every two days at most.
