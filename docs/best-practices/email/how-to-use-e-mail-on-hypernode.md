# How To Use E-mail On Hypernode

For setting up e-mail we advice our customers to use Gsuite (Google) or Office365 (Microsoft) as they are specialized in e-mail. Not only is this the best way to decrease the chance of having your outgoing e-mail ending up in the spam folder (as their servers almost never get blacklisted), but you’ll also have more options like managing the spamfilter for incoming mail.

At Hypernode our goal is to optimize and maintain a high quality of our Hypernodes so we’ve made the decision to focus on the webserver-aspect of the hosting business.
Unfortunately, this means we no longer offer email packages on the Control Panel. We recommend looking for a different email provider (like the ones below) since we will no longer maintain nor provide updates on the old email packages.
