# How to Resolve a 413 Request Entity Too Large Error

When your shop is giving a `413 Request Entity Too Large` error, the data send to the server in a POST request is larger than the max allowed body size in Nginx.

To solve this issue create a Nginx include file as `/data/web/nginx/server.bodysize` and set the following setting:

```nginx
client_max_body_size 300M;
```

The default in our Nginx configuration is set to `client_max_body_size 120m;` but you can easily override this value yourself in case of bigger sizes of POST data.

*Keep in mind that changing this setting to a higher value can increase memory usage on the server. Donâ€™t change this value on Hypernodes with high memory usage as it can easily make your shop run out of resources when under attack or in case of high load.*
