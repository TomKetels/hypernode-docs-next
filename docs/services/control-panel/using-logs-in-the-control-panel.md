# Using Logs in the Control Panel

You can review the logs in the Control Panel to get a better understanding of actions you or others have performed for your account.

Access the logs by clicking **Logs**in the sidebar on the left:

At the top you can filter the logs by date. By clicking **Show more filters**you can filter on other details.

The logs show the following things:

- When an action was performed
- The user that performed the action
- The action that was performed
- The Hypernode or user to action was related to
- The IP address from which the account was performed
- The source of the account, so the commandline or the Control Panel
