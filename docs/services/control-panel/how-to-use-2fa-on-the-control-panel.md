# How to Use 2FA on the Control Panel

Two factor authentication, also known as two-step verification, is a more secure way of logging in than logging in with just a password, because everyone receives a unique code to log in. In this article we explain how to use two factor authentication on the Control Panel.

How 2FA Works:

- You'll need access to your mobile device when signing in to the Control Panel.
- You'll enter a verification code each time you sign in. You can also select the **Remember this device for 30 days** option to receive a verification code prompt only once every 30 days.
- You'll need a verification app to receive the verification code.

## How to Enable 2FA

First, you need to download and install an authentication app. A few options are Google Authenticator, Duo Mobile, 1Password or Authy.

Then, you can turn on 2FA for your Hypernode Control Panel:

1. Sign in to the Hypernode Control Panel.
1. Hover over your username in the upper right corner.
1. Click on Account settings.
1. Click**Manage 2FA** to manage your 2FA settings.
1. Click the **Activate 2FA**button and click on **Start now**.
1. Add a new account in your authentication app. In most apps, you can do this by tapping the + icon.
1. Scan the QR code by using your device's camera. If you prefer, you can choose to enter the code by hand.
1. On Hypernode's 2FA configuration page, enter the 6-digit verification code that your authentication app generates.
1. To finish, click **Confirm**.

You'll receive an email when you enable 2FA and this will also be shown in the logs.

## How to Disable 2FA

1. Sign in to the Hypernode Control Panel.
1. Hover over your username in the upper right corner.
1. Click on Account settings.
1. Click**Manage 2FA** to manage your 2FA settings.
1. Click on **Disable Two-Factor Authentication** and enter the verification code to confirm.

You'll receive an email when you disable 2FA and this will also be shown in the logs.

## Troubleshooting

### Backup Codes

If you lose your phone or you've deleted your authentication app, you can use one of the backup codes to sign in. Each code can only be used once. Your backup codes were provided at the time you set up 2FA, but you can always find them on your Account page. We highly recommend you to save these codes somewhere safe.

If you receive a verification code you didn't request, there is a possibility that there's been an attempt to compromise your account. We recommend accessing your account and changing your password as soon as possible. If you lose access to your 2FA code generator, contact support@hypernode.com.
