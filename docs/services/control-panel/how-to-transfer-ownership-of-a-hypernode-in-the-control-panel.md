# How to transfer ownership of a Hypernode in the Control Panel

You can transfer ownership of a Hypernode. This means a different account will be charged for the Hypernode subscription. You also have the option to retain admin access after the transfer.

We will remove this Hypernode from all teams it belongs to and we will remove all SSH keys installed on this Hypernode to revoke access, excluding your admin access if you choose to retain this.

To transfer ownership of a Hypernode you need to follow these steps:

1. Log into the Control Panel.
1. Choose Â **Hypernodes** > **Transfer Ownership**.
1. Enter the email address of the new owner and choose whether or not to retain access as admin after the transfer.
1. The new owner receives a confirmation email and can then accept the transfer.

*Note that the new owner is required to have a valid payment method to accept the transfer, they have the option to do so at this step in case they do not have a valid payment method on their account.*
