# How to Schedule an Up -or Downgrade

**Please note that this article only applies to Control Panel customers that log in via my.hypernode.com.**

The schedule option on the Change plan page allows you to specify when your Hypernode plan will be up- or downgraded. You can schedule plan changes during off-peak hours to lower the impact on your visitors. This option is only available for Owners and Admins of a Hypernode plan.

## Scheduling an Up- Or Downgrade

- Navigate to Change plan page.
- Select the desired plan and the type of environment, Development or Production.
- Select 'Start change at a specific date and time' and fill in the required information.
  Important: the timezone in which to schedule plan changes is UTC +1 or +2, depending on wether it's daylight saving time or not.
- Agree with terms and conditions and click Change to this plan to schedule your change.

You can find your scheduled up- or downgrade in the Scheduled tab at the top of the page.

When your scheduled change isn't carried out for some reason, you will be notified of this by email.

## Removing a Scheduled Up- Or Downgrade

You can remove a change right up until the scheduled date and time.

- Go to the Scheduled tab on the Change plan page.
- Click on the trash can icon to delete a scheduled change.
