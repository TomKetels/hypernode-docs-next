# How to Log Into the Service Panel

**Please note that this only applies to Service Panel users who log in via service.byte.nl.**

This guide will explain how you can log in to the Service Panel and what to do if you don't have access to your data anymore.

## Logging Into the Service Panel

To log into the Service Panel go to [https://service.byte.nl/](https://auth.byte.nl/). You need the following information:

- Account number
- Password

After creating a Hypernode account, you should have received an email containing this information. If this is not the case, see the information below on how to retrieve these credentials or contact support via [support@hypernode.com](mailto:support@hypernode.com).

### Securing Your Account With Two Factor Authentication

Two factor authentication, also known as two-step verification, is a more secure way of logging in than logging in with just a password, because everyone receives a unique code to log in. In [this article](../control-panel/how-to-use-2fa-on-the-control-panel.md) we explain how to enable two factor authentication on the Service Panel.

## Forgotten Account Number
