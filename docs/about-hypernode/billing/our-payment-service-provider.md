# Our Payment Service Provider

In our Control Panel, we use Chargebee as our payment service provider, PSP for short. Chargebee processes transactions between us and our users and enables us to accept credit and debit payments as well as SEPA Direct Debit.

Through Chargebee, we make use of Stripe as the payment gateway. They securely validate credit card details and SEPA direct debit and pass this information between our customers and us and then between us and the bank.

Chargebee is therefore a sub processor of the customer data. We have a [Data Processing Addendum](https://www.chargebee.com/privacy/dpa/) (DPA) with Chargebee and they are PCI compliant.

All of the data is handled safely and securely and will never be shared with third parties. You can read more about security and compliance at Chargebee on [their website](https://www.chargebee.com/security/).

If for whatever reason you no longer want us to use your personal data, you're free to change your mind. We will always honor your right to be forgotten, unless we're legally required to keep your data. Send a request to [support@hypernode.com](mailto:support@hypernode.com) and we will get back to you.
